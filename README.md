Drawing inspiration from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-y_lnzWQjk&t=412s, I designed a simple robot that performs integral calculus through the relationship of radius, angular velocity, and tangential velocity. I have not been able to finish the project but it served as a good exercise in modeling using SolidWorks. In order to achieve a desirable axial translation to power a disc, I developed a mathematically defined gear solution to design my own gears. 

The parts used to design the robot are found here: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3JFSUJ551WVP0?ref_=wl_share.

Note: this project is incomplete and likely has many unresolved design issues.
